# Deploying AgroVerse on Render (Static Site)

This guide will help you deploy your AgroVerse React Native Expo project as a **static site** on Render - the most efficient and cost-effective option for web apps.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Render account (free tier available)
- Your project pushed to a GitHub repository

## Why Static Site Deployment?

âœ… **Faster Loading** - CDN-delivered static files  
âœ… **More Cost-Effective** - Free tier with generous limits  
âœ… **Better Performance** - No server-side processing needed  
âœ… **Auto-Scaling** - Handles traffic spikes automatically  
âœ… **Global CDN** - Fast worldwide access  

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Project

Your project has already been configured with the necessary files:

- âœ… `package.json` updated with web build scripts
- âœ… `render.yaml` configuration file created
- âœ… `app.json` optimized for web deployment
- âœ… `serve` package added for serving the built files

### 2. Push to GitHub

Make sure your project is pushed to a GitHub repository with all the recent changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure project for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Deploy on Render

#### Option A: Using render.yaml (Recommended)

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign in
2. Click "New +" and select **"Blueprint"**
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Select the repository containing your AgroVerse project
5. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file
6. Click "Apply" to start the deployment

#### Option B: Manual Static Site Setup

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign in
2. Click "New +" and select **"Static Site"**
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the site:
   - **Name**: `agroverse-static`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`
   - **Auto-Deploy**: Yes (recommended)

### 4. Environment Variables (if needed)

If your app requires environment variables:
1. Go to your service dashboard on Render
2. Click on "Environment"
3. Add any required environment variables

### 5. Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:
1. Go to your service dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" > "Custom Domains"
3. Add your domain and follow the DNS configuration instructions

## Build Process

The static site deployment process will:
1. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Build the web version (`npm run build`)
3. Deploy static files to global CDN
4. Configure routing and security headers

### ðŸ”§ **Your Static Site Configuration:**
```yaml
Type: Static Site
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
Publish Directory: dist
Auto-Deploy: On every Git push
CDN: Global content delivery network
Headers: Security headers included
Routing: Client-side routing configured
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**: 
   - Check that all dependencies are properly listed in `package.json`
   - Ensure your code is compatible with web deployment

2. **White Screen**:
   - Check the browser console for errors
   - Ensure all assets are properly referenced

3. **Routing Issues**:
   - Configure your router for web deployment
   - Check that navigation components are web-compatible

### Expo Web Compatibility

Some React Native features may not work on web. Common incompatible features:
- Camera access (use `expo-image-picker` web fallback)
- Location services (ensure web permissions)
- Push notifications (use web push notifications)

## Project Structure

```
AgroVerse/
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/                 # Built web files (generated)
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/              # Images and static files
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/             # App screens
â”œâ”€â”€ config/              # Configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         # Updated with web scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ app.json            # Expo configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ render.yaml         # Render deployment config
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This file
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start Expo development server
- `npm run web` - Start web development server
- `npm run build` - Build for web deployment
- `npm run serve` - Serve built files locally

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Render's build logs in your dashboard
2. Test the web build locally with `npm run build && npm run serve`
3. Ensure all web-specific dependencies are installed

Your AgroVerse app will be accessible at the URL provided by Render after successful deployment!
